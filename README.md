# What is this? #
SHOUTcast manager was created 4 years ago to serve the purpose of hosting internet radios to as many as possible - Recently with all the issues of the legacy SHOUTcast binary not working it was updated to work with the latest SHOUTcast v2.x on all oses thats supported (Windows & Linux etc...) 

The software never sold very well, its been sitting "collecting dust" as some might say, so i've decided to just release it for free for many to try! 

I can offer limited support via my website (you'll need to register an account to get a copy of it) OR add an issue on GitHub and i'll look at it asap!

The copy you are seeing on here (GitHub.com) is for other developers to see the inner workings of such a script - You may required a license key to use this software which can be obtained here (its FREE dont worry - Just click the "Add to Cart" button): https://client.scottishbordersdesign.co.uk/scripts/15/Monthly+SHOUTcast+Manager.html


# Why SHOUTCast Manager? #
Currently (correct me if im wrong) this is the only fully featured FREE PHP SHOUTcast management tool avilable that has support for PHP 5.x, 7 & 7.1 and that has been configured to work with SHOUTcast v2 (with SHOUTcast v1.x legacy support!)
